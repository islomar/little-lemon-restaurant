## Course Introduction
- Open-sourced in 2015, developed by Meta
- RN can also be used to create Windows apps and TV apps
- Hybrid apps: 
  - e.g. Apache Cordova
  - hybrid apps do not have access to built-in native features of the mobile device.
  - Hybrid apps render the graphic elements via a browser, which takes several steps to start showing the components on the screen. These are essentially web views.
- Cross-platform apps: e.g. React Native
- Native mobile components, e.g. `Text` and `View`
- Interview to Eric Hartzog
- Expo Go quickstart vs RN CLI quickstart
